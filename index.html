    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      Final-year Electronics and Instrumentation undergraduate student at
      Universitas Gadjah Mada, set to graduate in August 2024. With hands-on
      experience in the field of research and development (RnD), I have
      technical skills in the development of hardware and software
      interconnected through networks for IoT applications. I am also capable of
      designing, testing, and programming control systems in automation systems.
      My internship experience has further enhanced my non-technical skills,
      such as project management, teamwork, analytical thinking,
      problem-solving, and the implementation of safety protocols. Additionally,
      I have participated in campus organizations as a staff member and
      coordinator of a division to improve my leadership and communication
      skills.
